# Elementary Logic Gates Documentation

This document provides detailed descriptions and truth tables for 15 fundamental logic gates used in digital electronics. Each gate's functionality is explained, along with its truth table and implementation methods using common electronic components.

## Contents

1. **NOT Gate**: Inverts the input signal.
2. **OR Gate**: Outputs 1 if any input is 1.
3. **AND Gate**: Outputs 1 only if all inputs are 1.
4. **XOR Gate**: Outputs 1 if the inputs are different.
5. **MUX (Multiplexer)**: Selects one of many input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line.
6. **DMUX (Demultiplexer)**: Routes a single input signal to one of several output lines.
7. **NOT16**: Inverts each bit of a 16-bit input.
8. **AND16**: Performs a bitwise AND operation on two 16-bit inputs.
9. **OR16**: Performs a bitwise OR operation on two 16-bit inputs.
10. **MUX16**: Selects one of many 16-bit input signals and forwards the selected input to a single 16-bit output line.
11. **OR18WAY**: Performs a logical OR operation on 18 inputs.
12. **MUX8WAY16**: Selects one of eight 16-bit input signals and forwards the selected input to a single 16-bit output line.
13. **MUX4WAY16**: Selects one of four 16-bit input signals and forwards the selected input to a single 16-bit output line.
14. **DMUX4WAY**: Routes a single input signal to one of four output lines.
15. **DMUX8WAY**: Routes a single input signal to one of eight output lines.
